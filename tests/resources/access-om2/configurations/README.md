# Example test configuration 

This contains some files of configuration from the [ACCESS-NRI/access-om2-configs](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/access-om2-configs) repository. The configurations contain only the files
checked with QA checks, so they are incomplete configurations.

There's a low vs high degree, and a BGC vs non-BGC to cover most of the different ACCESS-OM2 configuration specific QA tests.
